# Simple-To-Do-List-Manager

A script where users can add, delete, and view tasks stored in a text file. Example: Adding “Finish lab assignment” saves it to a todo.txt file, and the list can be displayed later.

Created the todo.sh file using `touch todo.sh`, edited it in Vi editor, made it executable with `chmod +x todo.sh`, and ran it using `./todo.sh`.
